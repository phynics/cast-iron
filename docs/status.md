# Status

Updated 2026-11-03. The repository is public. The 16-book expansion is locally verified and awaiting merge and deployment; the live site still has the original POC until that rollout. Branch `relationships` adds schema 3 on top of it (next section); it is not merged or deployed.

## POC acceptance checklist (spec section 11)

"Local" means the Playwright suite in `tests/e2e` passed against a real `dist/` build served at `/cast-iron/` by `tests/e2e/server.mjs`. Last local run: 37 passed in 1.6 minutes (chromium 18, webkit 18, mobile-chromium 1), including offline class-category and expanded-book browsing. `cargo xtask check` also passed.

| Item | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Static GitHub Pages deployment works | Live pass | [Deployment run 41576342801](https://github.com/phynics/cast-iron/actions/runs/41576342801) succeeded for `a6636f3`. Chromium installed the library from [the public site](https://phynics.github.io/cast-iron/), verified the contact and OGL notice, reloaded offline, and found Fireball offline. No page errors or third-party requests occurred. |
| Application is installable where browser support allows | Local pass | `Application is installable where browser support allows` |
| Representative rules dataset installs completely | Local pass | `Representative rules dataset installs completely` |
| Download integrity is verified | Local pass | `Download integrity is verified` (corrupted shard rejected; retry fetches only that file) |
| Search operates entirely offline | Local pass | `Search operates entirely offline` (p95 < 100 ms asserted) |
| Category and sourcebook browsing works | Local pass | `Category and sourcebook browsing works` checks every publication; `Expanded books and separate class categories work offline` checks 16 books and the distinct categories. |
| Rule entries preserve complex formatting | Local pass | three `Rule entries preserve complex formatting: …` tests |
| Cross-reference navigation works | Local pass | `Cross-reference navigation works`, plus the deep-link test |
| Back/forward navigation works | Local pass | `Back/forward navigation works` |
| Bookmarks persist across restarts | Local pass | `Bookmarks persist across restarts` (persistent browser profile, relaunched offline) |
| Interrupted installation can recover safely | Local pass | `Interrupted installation can recover safely` |
| Offline launch works after a new browser session | Local pass | `Offline launch works after a new browser session` |
| No application feature requires a runtime server | Local pass | `No application feature requires a runtime server` (zero server requests after install, apart from the browser's own `sw.js` update check) |
| The compiler generates repeatable artifacts | Local pass | Two final full-corpus compiles were byte-identical. CI job `content` compiles twice and compares. |
| Licensing information is preserved and accessible | Local pass | `Licensing information is preserved and accessible` |

Phase 6 also requires that bookmarks survive a content update. `Content update keeps user records` covers this. A separate real-browser check installed the actual published schema-1 POC library in the new app, bookmarked Arcane Archer, reloaded offline, installed schema 2, and confirmed the bookmark and offline reading survived. `scripts/check-library-upgrade.py` also confirmed all 1,937 published IDs and titles are preserved.

## Expanded corpus, locally verified

Content version `v91f4bc8ffd606a17`, schema 2. Classes has 27 entries; Prestige classes has 19, including Technology Guide's Technomancer.

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Entries | 9,112 across 16 publications |
| Download | 58,487,268 bytes raw |
| WASM | 1,212,369 bytes raw; 450,990 bytes gzip |
| Search index | 19,264,125 bytes raw |
| Search latency | p50 2.5 ms, p95 4.8 ms, max 5.4 ms over 20 queries in desktop Chromium |
| Index load | 24.2 ms from the Cache API |
| Links | 1,304 resolved, 128 out of selection, 38 broken upstream |
| Intentional omissions | 432 source occurrences, including duplicated story copies and partial-body omissions; no malformed-record rejections |

These are desktop measurements, not real-phone memory or speed results. Light and dark Prestige classes screens were inspected at 390 px and 1280 px. The original library stayed readable under the new app before the schema-2 update was installed.

| Publication | Entries |

| Advanced Player's Guide | 768 |
| Advanced Race Guide | 516 |
| Bestiary | 545 |
| Bestiary 2 | 428 |

| Ultimate Magic | 422 |

The selection has 64 typed directories and 101 complete rules trees. Unsupported standalone record families and duplicated section-file representations remain listed in coverage. Later books absent from the pinned snapshot are not included.

## Relationships and book order, schema 3 (branch `relationships`)

Content version `vfafc1b3f4779e6f0`, schema 3. Verified locally: `cargo xtask check` passes; two `cargo xtask content` runs give the same tree hash; `scripts/check-library-upgrade.py` finds all 9,112 earlier ids and titles with no kind change and no dangling reference in the three new files; the Chromium project of the browser suite passes against the built site (18 tests). Data findings: `docs/research/relationship-data.md`. Decisions: `docs/decisions.md`.

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Entries | 9,967 (was 9,112): 218 archetypes, 342 racial traits, 295 traits |
| Relations | 1,531 edges: 342 `part`, 218 `archetype`, 971 `prerequisite` |
| Feat prerequisites | 1,002 feats with wording; 597 name a feat; 969 of 1,298 name-like requirements resolve (74.7%) |
| Spell lists | 23 class names, 8,010 distinct pairs (8,504 upstream); 8 names have no class entry: Arcanist, Bloodrager, Elementalist Wizard, Hunter, Investigator, Shaman, Skald, Warpriest |
| Book view | 16 books, 9,967 entries placed, 0 unplaced; chapter list unverified against the printed books |
| Download | 61,819,478 bytes raw (was 58,487,268, +5.7%); largest shard unchanged at 524,249 bytes |
| New files | `relations.json` 173,675 (14,491 gzip); `lists.json` 128,922 (28,157); `books.json` 1,062,338 (150,429) |

The client reads schemas 1, 2, and 3 but does not use the new files yet.

## Not verified yet

- GitHub CI and deployment for this expansion are pending. POC PR CI passed on GitHub in runs 41569305309 and 41569305238. The first Pages attempt failed before Pages was enabled. Deployment run 41576342801 then succeeded and the public site passed the live smoke check.
- Firefox: the tests exist, but Playwright's Firefox does not start on the development machine (macOS 27). CI runs Firefox as non-blocking.
- Real devices: Android Chromium, iOS Safari, installed-app (standalone) relaunch.
- Persistent storage: headless Chromium reports "not granted". On real browsers the result depends on browser heuristics.

## Known gaps

- Licensing review is scoped to the 16 selected books. The publication screen covers all 9,112 entries and found no issue, but does not classify every sentence or establish blanket rights to new sources. See `docs/research/licensing-audit.md`.
- Paizo Community Use Policy: on 2026-11-03 the official policy, FAQ, reinstatement post, and licensing overview were fetched and compared with the built Legal page. The notice matches the policy text, and the page shows a contact link. No registration is required. This does not clear every sentence of the dataset, and Paizo can withdraw the permission at its discretion. Details are in the audit.
- No "Referenced by" list for body links (needs a reverse link index). The typed relations have one in `relations.json`; no screen uses it yet.
- Facet chips show global counts, not counts that depend on the other filters.
- In spell and creature `spells` stat lines, upstream lists become lines with breaks, so list structure is lost.
- Heading ids are not prefixed, so a content anchor could collide with an app element id such as `main`.
- Firefox, and a single flaky run of `Back/forward navigation works` on Chromium, which could not be reproduced (see `docs/decisions.md`).

## Next (post-POC, spec section 12)

1. Keep the licensing review current when changing the source selection. The POC is public under the scoped OGL and Community Use review.
2. Review `sources/psrd-data/book-order.toml` against the printed books. Add standalone support for the families that remain in rules trees or are excluded (animal companions, mythic spells, vehicles, settlements, haunts, campaign resources and armies) when a category needs them. Newer books require a new source pin or source dataset and licensing review.
3. Run the suite on real devices and record the results here.
